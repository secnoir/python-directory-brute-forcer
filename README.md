# Simple Python Directory Brute Forcer

This is one of my first Python security scripts. It brute-forces website directories by trying a list of common paths and shows which ones exist (200 OK) or are blocked (403).
I built it to learn how directory brute forcing works under the hood, instead of just using tools like Gobuster or Dirb. It helped me understand HTTP status codes, requests, and how wordlists can reveal hidden parts of a site.
